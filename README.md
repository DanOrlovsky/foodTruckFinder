# About Food Truck Finder

Food Truck Finder is the App the foodie community has been clamoring for! 

The goal for this application was to bring food trucks, consumers and vendors together in an easy-to-use application.

Users can log in as either a consumer or Food Truck Owner.

# Consumer 
As a consumer, you will be able to see where local food trucks are within your designated mile radius. Using geo location, the app will use the consumers location, then show the open foodtrucks in their area. The user can then choose a foodtruck and get both map directions and written directions from their location to the food truck. 

# Food Truck Owner
As a food truck owner, you are able to login and input your location, photos of your food truck, and most importantly, whether or not you are open. This feature is important because we want to make sure consumers are only able to see food trucks open at the time they are looking.
